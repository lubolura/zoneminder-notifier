0.3.0 [lubolura]
    - events as well as frames are now selected from database, not via API
    - in case of video analyse - video is analysed as soon as is created

    - score_treshold in cfg file :
      when there is "detect_in: image", the "score_treshold" filter is applaied for
      all available images. Images with higher score than this, are continously
      analyzed as soon as they are available. It should be range 0-255.
      If score_treshold is set to 0, all images are analyzed
      (this is demand/impact to computer performance in this case! ).
      the default value is 1

    - positive_detections_per_event_in_batch_limit in cfg file :
      how many positive detection/frames interrupt continously frames analyze process in one batch per one event.
      Batch size depends on [Daemon] section setup, each round means one batch in this case
      ( it can be that one event has multiple batches, in case that event takes longer than one round)
      the default value is 1


0.2.1 [lubolura]
    - the analyse triger is fired once the event is finished now (prevent missing video file error)
    - best (maxscored) image frame for analyse is selected from zoneminder database
